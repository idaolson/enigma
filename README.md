# Enigma Project
## Ida Olson - 2107 BE Turing School
## Self-Evaluation

### Functionality:
**Meets expectations** - I successfully implemented the encrypt and decrypt methods and their command line interfaces.

### Object Oriented Programming:
**Above expectations** - I used a module, Cipherable, to abstract the helper methods for the Enigma class, and within that module, I broke the helper methods down to each perform a single function.

### Ruby conventions:
**Meets expectations** - Ruby conventions for spacing were followed and the longest method is 11 lines long. Names were selected for ease of understanding and in accordance with convention. Enumerables and data structures were chosen appropriately. Hashes were implemented.

### Test Driven Development:
**Meets expectations** - All methods tested and tests were written before code was implemented. Test coverage metrics show 100% coverage. Punctuation and capitalization edge cases are addressed.
